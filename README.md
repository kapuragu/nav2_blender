# nav2_blender
 JinMar's Blender add-on for importing Fox Engine .nav2 files.
 
 Based on research by OldBanana12: https://github.com/oldbanana12/Obj2Nav2

 "It's based on the .bt templates, so credit to OldBanana, sai, Bob and whoever worked on the format. 
 I hope it'll make visualization easier for whoever wants to take a look at the format."
